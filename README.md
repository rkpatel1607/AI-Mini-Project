# AI-Mini-Project

1. Created a file named as "code.py" to implement the question classifier.
2. Train the model by using supervised classification. Identify question and statement by using dialogue act tagging implemented by making use of nps chat corpus in nltk . 
3. The corresponding outputs of classifer are stored into "Question Analysis.xls" and labeled all the outputs as 1 or 0 in  the text file called "output.txt".
5. Then, tested and compared the Linear SVM, LR, NB and some other models to get the highest accuracy.
